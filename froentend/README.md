# Current Work: Chat Application

## Overview

I am developing a chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time. The application will feature user authentication, chat rooms, direct messaging, and notifications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time using WebSocket or similar technology.
- **Chat Rooms**: Users can join different chat rooms based on their interests or topics.
- **Direct Messaging**: Users can send private messages to each other.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for new messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io

## Current Progress

- User authentication has been implemented.
- Basic chat room functionality has been developed.
- Real-time messaging is being tested.
- UI components are being styled using CSS and a library like Bootstrap.

## Next Steps

- Complete the implementation of direct messaging.
- Add user presence indicators (online/offline status).
- Enhance the UI/UX for a better user experience.
- Test and deploy the application.
