# Current Work: Chat Application

## Overview

I am developing a chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time. The application will feature user authentication, chat rooms, direct messaging, and notifications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time using WebSocket or similar technology.
- **Chat Rooms**: Users can join different chat rooms based on their interests or topics.
- **Direct Messaging**: Users can send private messages to each other.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for new messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io

## Current Progress

- User authentication has been implemented.
- Basic chat room functionality has been developed.
- Real-time messaging is being tested.
- UI components are being styled using CSS and a library like Bootstrap.

## Next Steps

- Complete the implementation of direct messaging.
- Add user presence indicators (online/offline status).
- Enhance the UI/UX for a better user experience.
- # Test and deploy the application.

# Chat and User Authentication API

This API is built with Express.js and MongoDB to handle user registration, login, and chat functionality, including creating one-on-one chats and retrieving users.

## What It Does

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in with JWT-based authentication.
- **Chat Management**: Allows users to initiate or retrieve one-on-one chats with other users.
- **Protected Routes**: Secures certain routes so only authorized users can access them.

## Routes and Their Functions

### User Routes

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/user`       | Registers a new user                                          |
| `POST` | `/api/user/login` | Authenticates user login and provides a JWT                   |
| `GET`  | `/api/user`       | Retrieves all users, excluding the logged-in user (protected) |

| Method | Endpoint    | Description                                                       |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | Checks for or creates a one-on-one chat between users (protected) |

## Getting Started

To set up the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, configure environment variables (`PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`), and start the server using `npm start`.

This overview provides the core functionality and routes, making it easy to understand the purpose of each endpoint.
